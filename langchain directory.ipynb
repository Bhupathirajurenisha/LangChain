Unplanned machine downtime which is leading to loss of productivity. Business Solution : Implemented a predictive maintenance solution using machine learning models on sensor and operational data to reduce unplanned machine downtime and improve productivity in pump manufacturing. Technology Stack used : Programming Language: Python Libraries: pandas,numpy,scikit-learn,TensorFlow,PyTorch Data Storage: PostgreSQL,MongoDB Data Collection: IoT sensors, Edge computing devices. Visualization: Matplotlib,Seaborn,Tableau Business Benefits : Implementing predictive maintenance models minimizes unplanned machine downtime, thereby increasing productivity, reducing maintenance costs, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.\\n\\nA Study on Standard Charted Bank -2022\\n\\nObjectives of The Study :\\n\\n1.To study the organisational structure of the bank. 2. Marketing mix of bank. 3. To understand the SWOT Analysis of the bank.\\n\\nScope of the study : The study examines customer preferences and satisfaction with Standard Chartered Bank's services from its inception to 2021. Research Methodology of the study : The study relies solely on secondary data gathered from the internet and books. Sources include Standard Chartered Bank’s annual reports from India and global branches, published on official websites, to analyze financial performance. Secondary data, unlike primary data collected directly, is pre-existing information from published and unpublished sources. Limitations of the study :\\n\\n1. Only secondary data has been taken for the purpose of this project. 2.Reports of the working of the bank were taken from websites other than the bank. The authenticity of these reports is not known. Findings :\\n\\n1.Standard Chartered Bank operates with a Department Line Organisation structure, with authority flowing from top to bottom. 2.The bank’s new structure aims to streamline decision-making, cut costs, and reduce bureaucracy. 3.Key trade services include Import/Export, Supply Chain Financing, and Trade Distribution. 4.Other services offered are Mergers & Acquisitions, Project Finance, and Structured Solutions. 5.With around 1,700 offices globally, Standard Chartered is one of the largest and oldest banks, generating 80% of its profit from emerging markets. 6.It ranks #83 on Forbes's list of top multinational performers and is a major player in trade finance.\\n\\nConclusion: Standard Chartered faces a skilled labor shortage in emerging markets. Rather than hiring costly external candidates, the bank risks overlooking internal talent that contributes significantly but is undervalued. Suggestions :\\n\\n1. Standard Chartered Bank's conservative marketing strategy is a potential weakness. 2.The bank should enhance its online presence and services. 3.More staff are needed to support its large customer base. 4.Anticipating and preparing for threats is essential. 5.Innovation in product offerings is lower than competitors.
